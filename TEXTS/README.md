Four texts of each type -- lexical, semantic and syntactic.

Lexical changes are straightforward replacements of a word with a harder synonym.
Semantic changes are replacing a word with another which makes grammatical sense, but is unexpected in the context of the rest of the passage.
Syntactic changes are the pairing of a garden path sentence with another sentence which means the same thing but makes the meaning more evident.
